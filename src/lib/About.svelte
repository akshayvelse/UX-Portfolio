    I'm a Junior UI UX Designer from Kerala, India, pursuing my career as a User Interface and Interaction Designer. 
    I enjoy turning complex problems into simple, beautiful, and intuitive designs.

At first, I was not sure whether to call myself a UI designer or a UX designer. 
But getting to know about the terms I knew that I was equally fascinated by user interactions and the product design. 
So I decided to call myself a UI and UX designer. The very next thing I was trying to find out was the concept of standing out.
How to make my designs stand out? How to make my designs special from others. 
But my experience made me realize that the one and only thing that can make my designs special is me. 
I am the only person who can make my designs stand out, by adding my individual essence to my work. Up to this point, 
I firmly believe in this principle. 
All of my designs contain a specific essence by which no other designs will ever replicate, the essence of me.
